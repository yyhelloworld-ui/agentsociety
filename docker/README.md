# Dependencies installed by Docker

The folder contains the docker-compose.yml and related files for running the dependencies (PostgreSQL, MQTT Broker, mlflow) for the project quickly.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- A *proper* network to allow your Docker to pull images from the internet (use proxy or Docker mirror)

## Install Docker

The official installation instructions can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/).

If you do not want to read the documentation and **the OS is Linux**, you can try the following (make sure you have the right (sudo) permission to run the script):
```bash
# If your machine is in China
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh && sh get-docker.sh --mirror Aliyun
# If your machine is not in China
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh && sh get-docker.sh
```

After the installation, you can run the following command to check if the installation is successful:
```bash
docker run --rm hello-world
```

If you failed to run the command due to timeout, you should check your network connection to make sure that it can access the docker registry outside of China.

Possible solutions:
- Use a proxy
- Use a Docker mirror
- Use a VPN
- Use a local Docker registry

## Run the dependencies

We provide a docker-compose.yml file and related files to start the dependencies.

Before running the following command, you need to change the password in the `docker-compose.yml` and `basic_auth.ini` file.
And make sure the password part of `PG_DSN` in the `docker-compose.yml` file's `mlflow` service is the same as the `POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD` in the `docker-compose.yml` file's `postgresql` service.

```bash
cd docker # make sure the folder contains the same files as the ones in the repo
docker compose up -d
```

If you want to check if the dependencies are running correctly, you can run the following command instead of the above command:
```bash
cd docker
docker compose up
```
But you need to use `Ctrl+C` to stop the them and use `docker compose up -d` to start them again and put them in the background.

## Stop the dependencies

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Access the services

- MLflow: http://localhost:59000
- PostgreSQL: postgresql://postgres:CHANGE_ME@localhost:5432/postgres
  - The default username and password are `postgres` and `CHANGE_ME`, respectively.
  - The default database is `postgres`.
  - You can use some GUI tools to access the database, e.g., [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/).
- MQTT Broker: tcp://localhost:1883
- EMQX (MQTT Broker) Dashboard: http://localhost:18083
  - The default dashboard username and password are `admin` and `public`, respectively.
  - You can follow [EMQX Docs - Authentication](https://docs.emqx.com/en/emqx/latest/dashboard/authn.html) to set MQTT authentication.

## Attention

SECURITY WARNING:
- CHANGE THE PASSWORD OF POSTGRESQL AND MLFLOW IN THE docker-compose.yml FILE and `basic_auth.ini`.
- CHANGE THE PASSWORD OF MQTT BROKER BY ITS GUI.
- SET FIREWALL RULES ACCORDINGLY.
